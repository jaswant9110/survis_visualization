# AI-Powered Personalisation for the Future of Wellness

This repository hosts a SurVis-based literature visualization developed as part of **COMP4037 – Research Methods** at the **University of Nottingham**.

## 📘 Project Overview

The SurVis instance provides an interactive visual classification of 10 peer-reviewed research papers in the domain of:

- AI-driven fitness and health recommendation
- Personalized wellness through machine learning
- Reinforcement learning in digital health
- Privacy-preserving recommender systems
- Adaptive nutrition and biometric-based recommendations

The literature is grouped into five categories:

| Category             | Selector (Keyword)   | Color     |
|----------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Foundational Techniques | `foundational`     | 🟣 Purple |
| Evaluation & Privacy    | `evaluation`       | 🟡 Yellow |
| AI in Health/Fitness    | `health`           | 🟢 Green  |
| Adaptive Learning Models| `adaptive_learning`| 🔵 Blue   |
| Nutrition Systems       | `nutrition`        | 🟠 Orange |

Each paper is color-coded and classified using one of these categories in SurVis.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `src/` — Contains the SurVis application files
- `literature.bib` — BibTeX file with 10 fully tagged academic papers
- `config.json` — Category selector configuration (color-coded)
- `index.html` — Root redirector to `src/index.html` for GitHub Pages

## 🛠 Local Setup

To run locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `src/index.html` in your browser

## 🚀 Deploying on GitHub Pages

1. Commit your files to the `main` branch
2. Place a redirecting `index.html` in the root folder
3. Enable GitHub Pages under repo settings → Pages → Source: `/ (root)`
